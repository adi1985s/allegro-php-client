Features
------------
  - full IDE autocompletion thanks to [wsdl2phpgenerator](https://github.com/wsdl2phpgenerator/wsdl2phpgenerator)
  - simple, fluent, robust yet flexible, OOP interface
  - support for custom logger (library then writes some info to it)
  - support for custom cache (caching is then enabled per call like this `$client->call()->cacheFor(10 * 60)->doSomeMethod()`)
  - support for parameters injection (eg. session ID, country code, user ID, ...) that will be prepended to all requests that support it, so that you don't have to write them by hand all the time
  - with some tiny hacks (rerunning wsdl2phpgenerator with your custom config) you can use your custom SOAP client too


Testers needed
----------------
This project is currently in beta and is looking for testers who would provide feedback on its design and functionality,
so that this library could reach a stable version. If you have any sugestions or complaints please [fill an issue](https://github.com/rindeal/allegro-php-client/issues/new).


Quick start
-----------
#### Installing
Add as a dependency to your `composer.json`
```json
"require": {
  "rindeal/allegro-php-client": "*"
}
```
or run `composer require rindeal/allegro-php-client` to do everything automagically

#### Usage
```php
require_once PATH_TO_AUTOLOADER;

// import appropriate tools
...
```
```php
// Ok, first you need to provide your credentials which are required to use WebAPI.
// This library doesn't support logins with plain text passwords so in case you have one,
// use `hash_password.php` utility found in the `bin` directory
$credentials = new ApiCredentials(WEBAPI_KEY, USER_LOGIN, HASHED_PASSWORD);

// then you need to keep them in a session which is also bound to a specific region
$session = new Session($credentials, new Country('cz'));

// and as soon as you have provided us this info, you may set up the final client object
$client = new Client($session);
```
```php
// you can call methods even when not authenticated yet
$res = $client->call()->doGetCountries(new DoGetCountriesRequest());

// but to do some real work you need to authenticate
$client->authenticate();

$res = $client->call()->doGetMyData(new DoGetMyDataRequest());
$userData = $res->getUserData();
printf("Hello %s %s!\n", $userData->getUserFirstName(), $userData->getUserLastName());
```

Another version of the authentication worklfow:
```php
...
$credentials = new ApiCredentials(WEBAPI_KEY);
...
$client = new Client($session);
...
$client->authenticate(USER_LOGIN, HASHED_PASSWORD);
```
or
```php
...
$credentials = new ApiCredentials(WEBAPI_KEY);
...
$credentials->userLogin = USER_LOGIN;
...
$client = new Client($session);
...
$credentials->hashedPassword = HASHED_PASSWORD;
...
$client->authenticate();
```
